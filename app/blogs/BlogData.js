        <p>In recent years, <strong class="text-blue-500">blockchain technology</strong> has emerged as a game-changer
        in various industries. It is the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies
        like Bitcoin and Ethereum, but its potential reaches far beyond digital currencies.</p>

        <b class="block mt-4 font-bold">What is Blockchain?</b>
        <p>At its core, a blockchain is a decentralized and distributed digital ledger that records transactions across multiple computers. 
        Each record, or block, is linked to the previous one, creating a chain of blocks. 
        This ensures security and transparency as transactions are irreversible once added to the chain.</p>
        
        <b class="block mt-4 font-bold">Applications Beyond Cryptocurrencies</b>
        <p>While blockchain's first application was in cryptocurrencies, its potential
        has led to the exploration of numerous use cases. Supply chain management,
        digital identity verification, voting systems, and smart contracts are just
        a few examples. Blockchain's decentralized nature eliminates the need for
        intermediaries and enhances security.</p>


        <b class="block mt-4 font-bold">Cryptocurrencies and Their Impact</b>
        <p>Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, are digital assets that use
        blockchain technology for secure transactions. Bitcoin, the pioneer of
        cryptocurrencies, introduced the concept of digital scarcity and decentralized
        financial systems. Ethereum brought smart contracts, which are self-executing
        contracts with the terms directly written into code.</p>


        <b class="block mt-4 font-bold">Challenges and Future Prospects</b>
        <p>Despite its potential, blockchain faces challenges like scalability, energy
        consumption, and regulatory uncertainties. However, ongoing research and
        development are addressing these issues.</p>

        <p class="mt-4">In conclusion, blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are reshaping
        industries and redefining how we think about trust and transactions.
        As the technology continues to evolve, we can expect even more innovative
        applications that have the potential to transform various sectors.</p>
